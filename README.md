# Quote-Application
A Random Quote Generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript displays a new quote each time the page is refreshed or when the user clicks the "New Quote" button. The application fetches quotes from an external API, ensuring fresh content with each interaction. It also includes a dedicated button that allows users to post the displayed quote directly to X (formerly Twitter), making it easy to share inspiration on social media. The app provides a simple, user-friendly interface, and ensures a smooth experience with responsive design and seamless integration with the social platform for sharing quotes.
